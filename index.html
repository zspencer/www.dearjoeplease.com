<h1>Dear Joe Biden,</h1>
<p>This plea comes from my own fear, ignorance and humility.</p>
<p>I was born in Michigan in the 80s. I grew up 30 minutes from Flint in the
economic devastation left by the failure of the automotive industry to adapt to
change.</p>
<p>And as I watch my self, my neighbors, my family, and my friends fight an illness
whose impact is completely outside our capacity to comprehend; I fear our
Government is making the same mistake.</p>
<p>Everything has changed.</p>
<p>Computers and robotics have created the highest productivity gains of all time.</p>
<p>The repairs you and Obama made between 2008 and 2016 created one of the most
significant, longest-running increase in GDP and financial markets ever seen.</p>
<p>And yet; in this time of unimaginable wealth; millions of American's shelter,
food, and healthcare has been threatened or stripped away due to circumstances
beyond our control.</p>
<p>We are suffering.</p>
<p>And we ask ourselves, where is the America we learned about in school?</p>
<p>An America that, when faced with cruelty and oppression said &quot;All are created
equal.&quot;</p>
<p>An America that was willing to tear itself apart and put itself back together to
ensure that no person is property.</p>
<p>An America that proudly proclaimed &quot;Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled
masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send
these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden
door!&quot;</p>
<p>How can we exercise our rights to life, to liberty, to pursue happiness when no
matter how hard we work we barely get by? When no matter what progress we make
it can all be ripped away in a moment?</p>
<p>Over the last half a century, American legislators chose, time and again, to
compromise with those who do not believe all are created equal. That the rights
we have enshrined in our constitution are only for those who already have
wealth, who have power, who have connections, or who bend themselves to the will
of those who do.</p>
<p>We compromised with cruelty. With people who believe black people deserve to be
shoved aside and shot in the streets. That immigrants are a liability and
menace, not an asset. That we cannot afford to guarantee shelter, food,
healthcare, and education for all Americans who want it.</p>
<p>And for what? So that the small amount of people who have the most economic
power can gather more?</p>
<p>With every compromise we cracked the United States of America.</p>
<p>And now it is shattered.</p>
<p>We need someone to put it back together. More resilient than it was before.</p>
<p>We need someone who will fight for the rights of every American to be sheltered,
fed, and cared for.</p>
<p>We need someone who will repair our ecosystem and create a better world for our
grandchildren's grandchildren.</p>
<p>We need someone who will dismantle the police-state that incarcerates millions
for non-violent offenses; stripping them of their rights.</p>
<p>We need someone who will not compromise with those who have shown us, time and
again, to act in bad-faith.</p>
<p>We need someone who refuses to compromise with people who use their power to
abuse the public trust to enrich themselves at the cost of the people.</p>
<p>We need someone who will fund infrastructure, not endless war.</p>
<p>We need someone who respects and craves accountability.</p>
<p>And so, I ask you this:</p>
<p>Are you that person? And if not, I beg of you: drop out.</p>
<p>And while many believe your greatest strength is as a peacemaker, I see your
greatest strength is standing behind those willing to put it all on the line.
You were the best Vice President in my lifetime; why not give it another go?</p>
<p>Use your connections, your influence, your expertise, your negotiation powers,
and your wisdom to make space for someone who will put everything on the line to
ensure that future generations live free.</p>
<p>We're begging you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zee Spencer, Postal Code 94609</p>
